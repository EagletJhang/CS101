LAN - Local Area Network

Checksum - receiver can detect that the packet was received correctly

##Multiple Computers -- Ethernet Design
###Send: 
- Every computer has a unique address on the wire 
- Packet includes to:addr of recipient 
- Sender waits for period of silence on the wire, sends packet 
- Packet spreads out on wire, reaching all computers 
- More "broadcast" than "send"
###Receive: 
- All computers listen to the wire all the time 
- Pick out packets addressed to them, ignore other packets
