"Signal" is a varying wave over time

Sound
-----------------
- Sound is vibrations, small waves of pressure in the air
- Sound often as a repeated up/down pattern


----------------
- Frequency is how often the wave repeats per second 
- Amplitude -- how high/low the wave goes, bigger waves = louder
- Timbre -- the shape of the wave sounds different 

------------------
- Chord 和音-- peaks and valleys match up nicely, sounds naturally good (e.g. double the frequency)
- Discord 不和音-- peaks and valleys don't match up, sounds bad
- Noise 雜音-cancelling headphones -- detect the ambient sound and create an exactly opposite sound, so when added together, it all cancels out to near silence.
