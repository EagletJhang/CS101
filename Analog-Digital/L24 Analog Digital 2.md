Digital Technology -- Digitization
-----------------
Each sample records the height of the signal from 0 as a number

Digital Playback
---------------
Playback = recreate signal from the numbers

Digital vs. Errors
---------------
Notice that, even with noise, the 0's/1's are obvious

Digital -- Compression
-----------------
eg.12000, 12002, 12006, 12007, 12010, 12005, 12006

12000, +2, +4, +1, +3, -5, +1


- Then record the differences, one sample to the next (aka delta)
- a "lossy" strategy
