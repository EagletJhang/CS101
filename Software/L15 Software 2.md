Compiler translates the source code into a large number of machine code instructions
------------------

Dynamic languages

e.g. Java, Javascript, Python

Can be implemented by an "interpreter"

-----------------------

Interpreter is a program which "runs" other code

e.g. web browsers includes a Javascript interpreter 

-----------------------

Dynamic languages tend to have more features (programmer-friendly)

Dynamic languages often allow the programmer to get things done faster 

However the dynamic code runs a bit more slowly compared to compiled code

JIT:Just In Time Compiler

All major browsers now have a JIT for the Javascript code they run (Chrome)
